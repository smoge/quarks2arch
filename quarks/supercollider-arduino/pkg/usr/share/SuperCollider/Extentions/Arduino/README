Arduino interface
------------------

This package provides a serial port interface to the Ardiuno I/O
board. Currently the only protocol supported is the ASCII based
SimpleMessageSystem.

Some examples can be found in the [Arduino] help file, with the
corresponding Arduino code in the `examples' directory.
